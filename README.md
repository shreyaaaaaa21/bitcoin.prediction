<h1>Bitcoin Price Prediction Project</h1>

<p>This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin prices using various machine learning models. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to predict future Bitcoin prices based on historical data.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The core of the project is to analyze historical Bitcoin price data and develop models that can accurately predict future prices. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab and demonstrates the following key steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data loading and preprocessing.</li>
    <li>Implementation of machine learning models for price prediction.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.</li>
    <li>Visualization of predicted vs actual prices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machine Learning Models Used</h2>
<p>The project implements several machine learning models to predict Bitcoin prices. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> A basic linear approach to model the relationship between the input features and the target variable (Bitcoin price).</li>
    <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> A non-linear model that splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):</strong> A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) specifically designed for time-series data, which is highly effective in capturing the temporal dependencies in Bitcoin prices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>The data preprocessing steps involve:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loading the dataset and examining its structure.</li>
    <li>Handling missing values and outliers.</li>
    <li>Normalizing the data using <code>MinMaxScaler</code> to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
<p>The models are evaluated using various metrics such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> Measures the average of the squares of the errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>R-squared (RÂ²):</strong> Indicates how well the model's predictions approximate the real data points.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p>The notebook includes visualizations to compare the predicted prices against the actual prices, making it easier to understand the model's performance. The visualizations are generated using libraries like <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>plotly</code>.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/shreyaaaaaa21/bitcoin-price-prediction.git</code></pre>
<p>Once cloned, upload the notebook to Google Colab and execute the cells step by step to see the output.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Ensure you have the following installed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>Google Colab account</li>
    <li>Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
